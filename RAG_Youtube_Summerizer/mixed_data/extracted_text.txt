what are you looking for a little Kitty well before you start looking for a white hole in the universe there are a few things you need to know about them let me explain the general theory of relativity now have managed to find its evidence in the universe by observing its impact on the surrounding area as the black holes powerful gravity pulls them towards it and finally in 2019 the international Event Horizon telescope manage to capture an image of a black hole giving a solid proof of their existence this historical Discovery has been the scientific community pointer the possibility of another cosmic phenomenon known as the White Horse someone watching distance they are the mathematical opposite of black holes meaning instead of pulling objects towards it a vital space things out of it and for that reason these cosmic objects of famously known as the black holes be connected to another evidence about White holes existence and formation all we have is a mathematical equation is in the context of which is the entry point to another space and time is highly controversial because according to Einstein's theory singularity at the centre of glycogen would prevent anything from passing through to the white hole on the other side which made the quantum scientist wonder then what happens to the wings that enter the black hole so some of them came up with an alternative theory that said is actually the result of a black hole according to this story and would no longer be the laws of Physics due to which Chinese this during game room to plenty of imagination and few scientist compare this behaviour of vitals with the concept of The Big Bang Theory yes the burst of energy and matter released from the Big Bang responsible for creating our universe looks incredibly similar to how White house work but again we don't have any concrete evidence of it and all we have for now is a mathematics and come up with an exact answer to the question what exactly is a vital and hopefully we will make a video on your achievement so good luck with your keep us updated about your work time did you know that the concept of existence of vitals was introduced in 1964 by Dimitri Vegas and in 2006 there was called 060614 that last date for 12 seconds some scientists believe that you learn something exciting today next time
