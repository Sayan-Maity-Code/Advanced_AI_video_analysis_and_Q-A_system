earthquakes and unexpected movements of the earth surface is called an earthquake when two parts of the Earth surface move suddenly in relation to each other along a fault line due to tectonic forces and earthquake occurs at tremendous amount of energy is released in the form of Travellers and vibrations such as earthquakes are called tectonic earthquakes the point of origin of an earthquake is called the focus while the point directly about on the surface of the earth is called the efficiency around the degree of destruction is Greater around the epicenter the branch of knowledge that deals with the study of earthquake is called seismology and the experts who studies seismic waves are called psychologist there are three types of size make waves that spread in all directions from the focus and always to reach the earthquake recording station as they travel 1.7 times faster than the shares are therefore called primary or private are called secondary the primary waves caused the particles of Rock to vibrate forward and backwards in the direction of the Waves secondary waves on the other hand cause the particles to oscillate at right angles to the direction of the Waves will be and is reach the surface of the earth take it converted into a long waves that travel along the surface vibrating horizontally at right angles to the direction of the Waves called love destruction is caused by the year to detect and record based on the depth of the foci earthquakes are classified into three types they are deep focus earthquakes that occur at depths exceeding 300 km the reasons for which have not yet been identified intermediate focus earthquakes with depth of ranging between 55 and 300 km less than 55 km to measure the magnitude of the earthquakes a rectangle is used on the scale is equivalent to 30 times the energy released by the previous unit while magnitude of 2 is seldom filled a magn 7 indicates the lower limit of an earthquake that has a devastating effect over a large area
